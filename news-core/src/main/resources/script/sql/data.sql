Just this week Romney said Trump should release his tax records, a public disclosure move that Romney made in 2012 but which Trump has been resisting.\nSome Republicans have been urging Romney to launch an independent bid for the presidency.

The strategy paid off last week when the New York businessman emerged as the Republican party''s presumptive presidential nominee, after sweeping a series of state nominating contests.\nSince then, Trump has said he would no longer self-finance and would work with the party to raise more than $1 billion to help him fight his eventual Democratic Party challenger. Critics accused him of flip flopping, but some supporters don''t agree.\nThree dozen of the 40 pro-Trump voters Reuters interviewed said they were not concerned about his reversal. Only four indicated the switch made them uneasy, though all of them said they would still support him.\nMost of those interviewed applauded the way the celebrity businessman billed himself as a \"blue-collar billionaire\" who didn''t need other people''s money, but said they understood Trump would need far more resources to compete in the general election.\nThey would have no problem donating to the billionaire, albeit in the same kind of small increments that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has used to build his nearly $200 million fundraising juggernaut. \n\"Even though I''m on welfare, I would donate to Trump,\" said Pamela Thompson, a 46-year-old mother of three school-age kids from Tulsa, Oklahoma. \"And my kids would run a lemonade stand to help elect him.\"\nThe supporters interviewed said Trump''s pledge to self-finance his campaign was less important to them than his promises to crack down on undocumented workers and ease the pain of mostly white, blue collar towns that have seen manufacturing jobs lost to developing countries.\nSharon Jones, a 53-year old Wal-Mart cashier from Coleman County, Alabama, says her anger over undocumented immigrants shopping at her store on welfare benefits is animating her support for Trump, who has promised to deport undocumented workers and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\"They are doing better than I am on my $9.45 an hour,\" Jones said.\nThe majority of supporters interviewed said they thought Trump''s decision to fundraise was strategically wise given that Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has raised more than $250 million so far. \nIn the 2012 election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney and his Democratic opponent, President Barack Obama, each raised $1 billion.\n\"You gotta fight fire with fire. Bring it on,\" said Cheryl Ressler Halvorson, a cattle rancher from Williston, North Dakota  whose support for Trump stems mainly from her ire over having to pay $1,100 a month for health insurance with a $13,000 deductible due to the government mandate known as Obamacare.\nHalvorson is not an outlier. Most Trump supporters have stayed loyal despite the candidate frequently reversing or updating policy positions on key economic and social issues.\nTrump is not the first U.S. presidential candidate to change his mind about financing his election campaign.\nIn the 2008 election, Obama also did an about-face. He said he would forego public financing of his general election campaign against Republican John McCain. This was a reversal of his earlier stance and it allowed him to pursue a record fund-raising effort. Supporters were unfazed by the shift and Obama went on to win the election.\n (Additional reporting by Grant Smith and Chris Kahn, editing by Ross Colvin)', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-05-13 10:18:56', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-05-13', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))

It also is suspected of causing a rare neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome, that can result in paralysis.\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest welcomed \"any sort of forward momentum in Congress\" while continuing to push for the full $1.9 billion.\n\"It could not be clearer that Congress needs to take action to help our states and our local officials fight the Zika virus. That is critical for health and safety of the American people,\" Earnest said.\nFlorida''s senators, Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, called for the full $1.9 billion, saying $1.1 billion was inadequate.\nThey noted that the Florida Department of Health has reported a total of 112 Zika virus cases, the most of any U.S. state, as the mosquito season goes into high gear with hotter temperatures.  \nOne proposal now before the Senate would provide Obama with his full $1.9 billion request for emergency funds. A second one would scale back Obama''s request to $1.1 billion.\nThese two options would not require spending cuts elsewhere to cover the Zika costs, Senate aides said.\nA third one would take money from Obamacare to pay for $1.1 billion in Zika response funds.\nEven if the Senate approves one of these proposals, its fate is uncertain in the House of Representatives, where Republicans are deeply divided over new Zika funding, according to aides.\nTwo senior Republican aides said the party''s House leadership has been unable to formulate a plan on Zika legislation and is preoccupied with internal party strife over Donald Trump becoming the presumptive presidential nominee, as well as a deadlock over Puerto Rico debt legislation and a budget blueprint that has been stuck in the House.\nWhile plans to unveil a new Puerto Rico bill on Wednesday were canceled, a third senior House Republican aide noted there is progress on that legislation and that \"discussions\" on a budget \"are moving forward as well.\"   \nSenate backers of each amendment will try to attach their competing proposals to an unrelated spending bill the Senate started debating on Thursday.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-05-12 22:04:13', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-05-12', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))

Backing from Paul, a former Republican candidate for president with libertarian leanings, lends bipartisan support to an effort to undo a little-noticed modification to a text governing procedural rules for the U.S. court system that civil liberties groups warn would drastically expand the FBI’s hacking authority.\nSo far, that cause has largely been championed solely by Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and digital privacy advocate. He has vowed to work to stop the rule change on grounds it would allow the government to use one warrant to access and search thousands or millions of computers at once, potentially implicating those suspected of no wrongdoing. \nMagistrate judges can normally only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, which is typically limited to a few counties.\nBut last month the Supreme Court, in a private vote, approved the amendments to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure, which would permit judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnot.\nCongress has until December 1 to pass legislation that would reject, amend or postpone the changes to Rule 41. If lawmakers do nothing, which is customary in these circumstances, the changes automatically will take effect.\nThe U.S. Justice Department, which is pushing for the rule change, has described it as a procedural tweak needed to modernize the criminal code, and has said it would not permit searches that are not already legal.\nAlphabet Inc’s Google has warned the change poses a “monumental” threat to the Constitution’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. \nLast year Paul and Wyden worked together to force a temporary expiration of the USA Patriot Act, which led to passage of surveillance reforms that pared backed the National Security Agency’s controversial bulk collection of U.S. call records.\nOther lawmakers are also examining Rule 41. \nRepublican Senator Mike Lee is looking at ways to address concerns, a spokesman said, and a small group of lawmakers in the House are weighing introduction of companion legislation, sources said.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-05-12 21:45:54', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-05-12', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))

But it adds to uncertainty over the future of Obama''s signature domestic policy achievement ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections, including whether enough health insurers will continue to participate in the program.\nInsurers have sustained losses from their Obamacare business, saying they have not attracted enough healthy customers to offset the costs of sicker members. Two of the largest players, UnitedHealth Group and Humana Inc, had already said they would not offer plans in many markets next year.\n\"If you''re going to lose more money, why participate?\" asked Steve Halper, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets.\nShares in hospital operators such as Community Health Systems Inc fell sharply, while insurer stocks including Aetna Inc, which plans to remain in at least 15 Obamacare markets next year, also declined.\nIn court papers, the administration had warned that a court victory for the House Republicans would lead to a spike in insurance premiums for Americans and force the government to pay more in tax credits to insurance policy-holders.\nAs part of an appeal, the administration is likely to press its argument that the House lacks legal standing to sue. \n\"This suit represents the first time in our nation''s history that Congress has been permitted to sue the executive branch over a disagreement about how to interpret a statute,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.\n\"It''s unfortunate that Republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing,\" Earnest added. \"They''ve been losing this fight for six years, and they''ll lose it again.\"\nREPEATED CHALLENGES\nConservatives have mounted a series of legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act since it was passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition. Collyer was appointed to the bench by Republican former President George W. Bush.\nThe law has helped bring insurance coverage to millions of Americans who previously had none, subsidizing the cost of insurance through tax credits. In addition, the federal government helped defray consumers'' out-of-pocket costs.\nThe House Republicans argued that the administration''s action violated the U.S. Constitution because it is the legislative branch, not the executive branch, that authorizes government spending.\n\"BIG win for the Constitution,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan wrote on Twitter.\nJonathan Turley, the lawyer who spearheaded the lawsuit, in a blog post called the ruling \"a resounding victory not just for Congress but for our constitutional system as a whole.\"\nThe appeals court in Washington may be more receptive to the administration''s arguments, in part because seven of its 11 active judges are Democratic-appointees, including four picked by Obama.\nThe case focuses on a cost-sharing provision of Obamacare that requires insurers to reduce deductibles and co-pays. Insurers are supposed to be reimbursed for these costs by the federal government. Cost-sharing is determined by the income of the policyholder and is a mechanism for reducing healthcare costs for lower-income households. \nThe Obama administration has interpreted the provision as a type of federal spending that does not need to be explicitly authorized by Congress. The House Republicans who filed the challenge disagreed.\nCollyer ruled that the cost-sharing provisions cannot be funded through the same permanent appropriation that covers tax credits made available under the law.\nThe judge rejected the administration''s contention that the appropriation should be viewed as permanent because the alternative interpretation would lead to \"absurd economic, fiscal and healthcare policy results.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in June 2015, in a ruling authored by Bush-appointed Chief Justice John Roberts, rejected a conservative challenge that could have gutted Obamacare, upholding nationwide tax subsidies crucial to the law. Roberts also wrote a major 2012 ruling preserving Obamacare.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-05-12 21:22:55', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-05-12', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))

Trump, who has never held elective office, is trying to unite Republicans behind his candidacy after a primary election campaign in which his fiery rhetoric on trade, immigration and Muslims rankled party elites.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed Trump had pulled even with Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 presidential election.\nDavid Rubenstein, co-founder of private equity powerhouse Carlyle Group, kicked off the three-day conference by asking the audience which candidate they thought would move into the White House in January after November''s election. The vast majority did not express an opinion on either Trump or Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\nAway from panel discussions on how the industry can salvage a poor start to the year - the average hedge fund is off 0.8 percent this year, according to eVestment - powerful Trump backers were working smaller venues around the Hotel Bellagio.\nAnthony Scaramucci, who hosts the conference and runs hedge fund investment firm Skybridge Capital, said he was reaching out to his contacts to convince them Trump would run his candidacy like an entrepreneur, something he said America needed. \n''ENTREPRENEURIAL AVENUE''\n\"You have an opportunity now to bring an entrepreneur and a team of advisers that are entrepreneurial, out-of-the-box thinkers into Washington,\" Scaramucci told Reuters. \"That''s the sell to potential donors.\"\nScaramucci has long been a powerful Republican fundraiser who originally backed Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in this year''s race and later Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor. \nHe said there would be the Trump \"Entrepreneurial Avenue\" versus the \"Clinton cul-de sac,\" a suggestion that economic growth would be stronger under the likely Republican nominee.\nScaramucci added that potential donors would soon get over any fears of publicly helping Trump.\n\"Candidate Trump has said some things that some business people think: ''Jeez, if I''m associated with some of those things, it could be perceived negatively for my business.'' I think that will wash away in the next two months,\" Scaramucci said.\nAmong big-name Trump backers at the conference were Pickens, an oil investor and hedge fund manager who previously supported Bush''s candidacy.\n\"Yes, I''m for Donald Trump,\" he said on stage, adding Trump was smart enough to get himself help where he needed it politically and that it would be refreshing to have a businessman instead of a politician in the White House.\n\"Donald almost always overestimates how successful he is,\" Pickens said, \"but nonetheless he has been out there and he does know something about what he is talking about.\"\n(This version of the story corrects paragraph three to remove reference to Mnuchin meeting with Griffin)', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-05-12 16:20:58', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-05-12', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))
INSERT INTO NEWS VALUES(29, 'Different this time? Trump candidacy could weigh on Fed thinking', 'SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON Donald Trump''s rise to de-facto Republican nominee for president poses an unusually high level of uncertainty for investors and businesses, potentially weighing on the economy and the Federal Reserve''s plan to raise interest rates this year.', 'SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON Donald Trump''s rise to de-facto Republican nominee for president poses an unusually high level of uncertainty for investors and businesses, potentially weighing on the economy and the Federal Reserve''s plan to raise interest rates this year.\nUncertainty is always present in elections and the Fed has hiked rates during past campaign seasons. \nBut the possibility of the firebrand New York real estate mogul occupying the White House presents a step up in risk because of the unconventional policies he has proposed and a lack of detail on how they will be achieved, economists say.\nPromising to \"make America great again\", Trump has raised fears of a trade war by saying he would slap steep tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports. He has also vowed to deport all 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States, and suggested, though later retracted, a partial default on U.S. debt.\nFed officials say they avoid discussion of domestic politics at rate-setting meetings. Transcripts from previous election-year policy discussions show that political uncertainty is a factor in their thinking, though there no clear pattern of a loosening or tightening bias in the run-up to elections.\nIn recent comments, some Fed officials have acknowledged that campaign rhetoric could spill over into the economy.\n\"If consumers, because of political rhetoric, are slowing their spending or just pausing a little bit, or capex is slowing down...that I''ve got to take into account,\" Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told Reuters last Thursday.\nAsked his view of Trump''s policy proposals, he said, “If I have one, you’ll never know what that is. I will never allow that to seep into my work.”\nAtlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said that it was fair to say the election \"could be a factor in this year''s economy.\"\nThe Fed kept rates on hold at 0.25-0.5 percent last month and signaled it was in no rush to raise them again soon, citing slowing economic activity despite an improved labor market. Fed policymakers in March forecast two rate hikes this year after raising them last December for the first time in nearly a decade.\nFED KEEPS EYE ON UNCERTAINTY\nFed Chair Janet Yellen and other Fed policymakers have often cited uncertainty over the economic, financial and policy outlook as a factor in their interest-rate decisions. The VIX measure of stock-market volatility is one approach to measuring uncertainty; querying influential business owners is another. The exact mix of measures the Fed uses is not known.\nStanford University professor Nick Bloom''s economic policy uncertainty index, which he presented to Yellen and economists at recently as April last year, is another approach that the Fed considers.\nThe index analyzes newspaper coverage of policy-related economic uncertainty and divergence between economic forecasters'' predictions on the U.S. outlook among other factors.\n\"When uncertainty is high, firms put on pause hiring and investment decisions,\" Bloom said in an interview. \"If Trump looks like a serious contender and is still making ''Mexican Wall'' and ''Trade Rape'' comments we will have the mother of all policy uncertainty spikes running up to the election.\"\nTrump has said he would build a wall on the Mexico-U.S. border and accused China of \"raping\" the U.S. with unfair trade policies.\nA rise in the index, Bloom said, would foreshadow declines in production, investment, and employment.\nPolicymakers pay close attention to financial market volatility as well as economic data. The Fed delayed an expected hike last September after China''s sharp economic slowdown caused stock market drops and a tightening in financial conditions.\nA strong Trump candidacy could similarly upset markets, economists say. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed Trump running nearly even with Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely U.S. voters, a dramatic turnaround since he became his party''s presumptive nominee.\nTraders see a 36.5 percent chance of a Republican taking the presidency, according to futures prices on the Iowa Electronic Market.\n\"If Trump gains in the polls and the market reacts poorly, that (market turmoil) would be a good argument for the Fed to stay on hold,\" said Cornerstone Macro economist Roberto Perli, a former Fed board staffer.\nChina and Mexico are the second and third largest trading partners of the United States, respectively.\n\"The trade stuff is anti-growth and harmful to the U.S. outlook,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of conservative think tank the American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\"He''s an utterly unpredictable political element at this point,\" added Holtz-Eakin, who was also chief economic policy adviser to Senator John McCain''s 2008 presidential campaign.\nTrump, who says his policies will boost U.S. jobs and business interests, has said he likes low rates, but has also said he would replace Yellen when her term expires in 2018 if he wins the presidency.\nSo far there''s little indication Bloom''s uncertainty index is about to spike. It fell to a reading of 98.39 in April, just above where it was in November ahead of the Fed''s well-telegraphed rate hike. Other readings of uncertainty, like the VIX, look similarly benign. Voters go to the polls on Nov. 8.\nHistorically, Bloom''s index jumps just ahead of tight presidential ballots, as well as during times of other policy uncertainty, such as the U.S. debt ceiling debate in 2011. A surge of 90 points in the index could presage a one percent decline in production and declines in employment and investment of about a half a percent each, based on Bloom''s models.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-05-12 16:07:04', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-05-12', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))

Nominees need Senate approval, after which they are protected from political interference until their terms expire.\nIn his interview, Trump said he \"absolutely\" backed efforts to diminish the Fed''s power and allow Congress to launch so-called \"audits,\" or outside reviews, of its policy decisions. He also backed away from his pledge to erase the more than $19 trillion in U.S. debt in eight years.\nRepresentatives for the Fed declined to comment on the report. \nWere Yellen to step down in 2018 after only one term, it would be the shortest Fed chairmanship since 1979. Since then, Fed chairs from Paul Volcker to Alan Greenspan to Ben Bernanke, Yellen''s predecessor, were reappointed by at least one incoming U.S. president. \nTrump said he favored the low interest rate environment and that raising rates would be a blow to the U.S. economy. Trump had accused the Fed in November of keeping rates low to help Obama, an assertion the White House rejected.\n\"The best thing we have going for us is that interest rates are so low,\" the New York billionaire businessman told Fortune. \n\"If rates are 3 percent or 4 percent or whatever, you start adding that kind of number to an already reasonably crippled economy in terms of what we produce, that number is a very scary number,\" Trump added.\nThe Fed cut its key overnight lending rate to near zero in late 2008 and kept it there for the next seven years to help the economy recover from the financial crisis. It raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point last December, its first hike in nearly a decade.\nTrump told Fortune he would take advantage of lower rates to refinance the country''s debt and boost government spending on infrastructure and the military. The magazine will publish a full transcript of the interview later this week. \nHe moved away from comments he made to the Washington Post earlier this month pledging to eliminate the national debt \"over a period of eight years.\"\nInstead, Trump told Fortune he could tackle a portion of it.\n\"You could pay off a percentage of it, depending on how aggressive you want to be,\" he said. \"I''d rather not be all that aggressive. I''d rather not have debt, but we’re stuck with it.\" \nTrump''s main Republican rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, has said he would audit the Fed and move it to a rules-based monetary policy.\nOther U.S. presidential candidates, including Democrat Bernie Sanders, have also pledged to change the Fed.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-04-20 21:13:56', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-04-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))

The blunt candidate, after initially saying it was \"disgraceful\" for the pope to judge another''s faith in God, said Francis was \"a nice man\" who was probably misinterpreted by the media. \nCatholics are a sizable U.S. voting bloc, comprising about a quarter of the electorate, says Georgetown University''s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate. Catholics nearly evenly split their presidential votes between Republicans and Democrats, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. \n''NOT A DIRECTIVE''\nPart of the increase in Trump''s support among Catholics is likely related to the dwindling number of Republican White House candidates, a field that has dropped from 12 in January to three - the Presbyterian Trump, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Southern Baptist, and Ohio Governor John Kasich, an Anglican.\nBut Mark Gray, a senior research associate at Georgetown, said the results also showed that Catholics who heard the pope''s message about Trump were not swayed.\n\"Many Catholics probably felt that the pope’s comments were not a directive on how they should vote or who they should support, and still others may never have been aware of the pope’s comments to begin with,\" he said.\nWhile opinion polls have shown few U.S. Catholics think it necessary to agree with the pope on every issue to be a faithful Church member, a Washington Post-ABC poll last September showed the pope had an 86 percent favorability rating.\nFather William Paul McKane, a Catholic priest in rural Montana who supports Trump, said he felt the pope''s comments had backfired with his flock.\n\"I call it paradoxical, to put it gently, that the pope said that, when he lives behind walls that are about 40 feet high and 40 feet across,\" he said, referring to the walls around Vatican City. \"That comment hurt his credibility with my parishioners.\"\nMcKane said he appreciates Trump''s speaking plainly about issues like security and the economy - issues he said were in line with Christian values of protecting the innocent - even if he dislikes some of the candidate''s more fiery comments.\n\"Trump’s verbiage does not sound compassionate,\" McKane said. \"I don’t hold him up as a paragon of Christian virtue, but I’m not looking for that in a candidate. I’m looking for someone who is prudent and can make good political decisions.\"\nCLERGY FAVOR CRUZ \nWhile support for Trump among ordinary Catholic Republicans is high - roughly equal to that among Republicans as a whole - the small sums of money flowing to the candidates from Christian priests, bishops, pastors and other clergy of all denominations tend to favor the evangelical Cruz.\nCruz received $155,500 in contributions from about 380 members of the Christian clergy who each gave above the $200 reporting threshold through February, compared with about $700 from 10 people for Trump and $3,500 from nine people for Kasich.\nMcKane is the only contributor listed in Trump’s campaign finance disclosures who identified himself as a Catholic priest, based on a Reuters review.\nOn the Democratic side, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont - the only Jewish candidate - has received some $85,400 from about 280 people ordained for religious duty in the church, compared with about $192,500 from about 250 individuals for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n    Clinton polls much better among church-going Catholic Democrats, with 67.8 percent support, compared to Sanders'' 29.3 percent, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, despite Sanders'' bid to liken his view to the pope''s, especially on wealth inequality and climate change.\nSanders and the pope met briefly on Saturday at the Vatican, where Sanders addressed a conference on social justice. \n (Additional reporting by Chris Kahn and Grant Smith in New York; Editing by Howard Goller)', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-04-20 19:22:38', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-04-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))

Their efforts have been complicated by opposition from some conservative lawmakers, even as they have been negotiating with the Obama administration over details.\n    Some conservative House Republicans, who want to protect creditors’ rights, have balked at an element of the bill that could allow Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, a so-called cram-down debt restructuring.  \n    Hatch, too, wants to protect creditors, but said the bill must include cram-down authority to ensure that more senior bondholders, like those holding Puerto Rico’s constitutionally backed public debt, are better protected. \n    \"Let’s face it, you''ve got to protect the preferred creditors. If you don''t do that, I mean, you''re violating the rule of law to begin with,” Hatch said, adding that he is working on a different approach to the legislation.\n    The internal division showcases the complexity of the task facing lawmakers - to keep Puerto Rico’s economy intact, while also protecting the competing interests of 18 classes of bondholders owed money by the island.  \n    In a brief interview with Reuters on Tuesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop expressed confidence that once rank-and-file House Republicans familiarize themselves with his bill, it will gain momentum. He added that \"bondholders and other players\" were beginning to contact lawmakers to talk up the legislation.\nLOOMING DEFAULT\n    Time is of the essence. Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank owes creditors $422 million on May 1, a payment the island’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said it cannot afford. A default at GDB, the primary liquidity source for most of Puerto Rico’s public agencies, would be the island’s most significant default to date.\n    The bill would also create a federal board to oversee Puerto Rico’s finances, but legislators are debating how much power it should have. \n    Hatch on Tuesday said an oversight board would need \"the power to resolve the problems.”\n    “If you don’t give them the power to do that, it’s just another bailout,” he said. “We’ll be back here two years from now.”\n   Hector Negroni, a prominent municipal finance investor, objects to the draft bill, saying it changes the rules under which debt was sold to investors and puts creditors at the bottom of the pile while ignoring the priority of payments.\n   That pivot will have a more adverse affect on the municipal bond market than any potential default in Puerto Rico, Negroni said on Saturday, in a panel discussion held by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Washington.\n    \"So we have a framework here which doesn''t help Puerto Rico, harms the state and local marketplaces by risking an expectation and change in the rules and raising borrowing costs,” he said. “So if it is not for Puerto Rico, and it is not for state and local governments, I''m not sure who this bill is for.”    \n    Representative Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat, told reporters on Tuesday that the bill is falling victim to intra-party divisions among Republicans. Hoyer said Republicans should collaborate with Democrats to advance a bill by next week that would need the support of only 40-50 of the House''s 246 Republicans.\n    That would be a dangerous political step for Speaker Ryan, however, because he would be turning his back on a majority of members of his own political party on a major piece of legislation during an election year.\n    For now, Republicans “seem to be at risk of not doing it at all,” Hoyer said, referring to a Puerto Rico debt relief bill.\n(The story is refiled to clarify that Negroni spoke on Saturday, not Friday, paragraph 15)', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-04-20 02:59:49', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-04-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))

After they were presented to the court for admission, Roberts signed in American Sign Language: \"Your motion is granted.\"Membership in the Supreme Court bar allows a lawyer to argue cases before the justices but most of its members never actually do so. \nRoberts, appointed by Republican President George W. Bush in 2005, is believed to be the first U.S. chief justice to use sign language from the bench. It was also the first time members of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Bar Association took part in a swearing-in ceremony at the court.\nThe lawyers then stayed for oral arguments in two cases in the ornate courtroom, assisted by an interpreter standing in front of the mahogany bench where the eight justices sit.\nThe lawyers were permitted to use an instant transcription service that was transmitted to electronic devices. Normally, no electronic devices are allowed in the courtroom.\nOne of the attorneys, Teresa Curtin of the Weitz &amp; Luxenberg law firm, said in a statement the event was aimed at encouraging more people with disabilities to embark on legal careers. When she began her law career in the late 1980s, there was only a handful of deaf lawyers in the United States, while now there are around 250, Curtin said.\nIn 1982, a deaf lawyer, Michael Chatoff, argued a case before the Supreme Court, assisted by a real-time transcription system. That case concerned whether a school board was required to provide a deaf student with a sign-language interpreter. Chatoff lost the case in a 6-3 ruling.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-04-19 21:25:58', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-04-19', 'YYYY-MM-DD'))

They said they had received information that more than 20 treatment providers at the Lawrence facility, including a nurse who prescribed medication to Rivera, were not properly licensed or supervised as required by state law and federal regulations. \nThe parents sued under the False Claims Act, which allows individuals to make claims that the federal government has been defrauded. \nDuring the one-hour oral argument, liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan signaled support for the parents'' fraud claims. Sotomayor said billing for services that were not carried out in full was like a government contractor providing the military \"guns that don''t shoot.\"\nKagan similarly questioned whether the claim against Universal Health Services was any different than a failure by a federal contractor to provide the military boots that can be worn and food that can be eaten.\nConservative Chief Justice John Roberts appeared more hostile to the fraud claim, saying companies should not necessarily be liable for fraud just because they do not follow every procedure.\n\"That causes concern, of course, because there are thousands of pages of regulations under Medicaid or Medicare programs,\"  Roberts said.\nMedicare provides healthcare assistance to the elderly.\nA federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2014.

The $160 billion deal fell apart last week as a result of other aspects of the Treasury reforms.\nUnder the new rule regarding debt, if a U.S. subsidiary transfers money to its overseas parent within three years before or after borrowing money from it, by paying a dividend or buying shares in the parent, then U.S. tax authorities could potentially treat the loan as if it was equity.\nThis means the interest on the debt would not be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. \nExperts said that European companies would still be able to shift profits via inter-group debt, but may have to do so gradually over a longer period of time.\n\"It, without doubt, significantly changes the rules of the game,\" said Stephen Shay, professor of law at Harvard University. \n\"In the old days you bought and then you levered up as much as you can and that is not going to happen in the same way, but how much of a constraint that becomes is unclear,\" he added.\nNancy McLernon, president of the Organization for International Investment, a trade group for the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, denied non-U.S. groups were routinely shifting profit overseas through debt. \n\"Where\'s the problem they (U.S. authorities) are trying to fix? It feels more like a tax grab,\" she said. \nShe said the complexity of the issue and uncertainty over how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. tax authority, would seek to use their new powers would make investing in new U.S. projects less attractive. \n\"It will have a chilling effect on foreign direct investment in the United States,\" McLernon added.\nBILLIONS AT STAKE \nThe Treasury says it is targeting situations where large debts are incurred to fund dividends shortly after an inversion or foreign acquisition, rather than the most common way U.S. subsidiaries accumulate inter-group debt. That is by having the subsidiary gradually pay all its profit to its parent as dividends and then borrow money from its parent for new investment. \n\"The proposed regulations generally do not apply to related-party debt that is incurred to fund actual business investment, such as building or equipping a factory,\" a Treasury factsheet released last week said.\nProviding the money a foreign company takes out of its U.S. subsidiary is in line with the U.S. company\'s profits, the transactions should escape IRS scrutiny, Shay said.\nCompanies don\'t usually publish details of their inter-group financing so it\'s impossible to put a figure on how much profit foreign companies shelter from U.S. tax through inter-group loans. Richard Murphy, professor of practice in international political economy at City University London, estimates the IRS could lose tens of billions of dollars in taxes each year in this way.\nCompanies that have reduced their U.S. tax bills via inter-group lending include drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, education group Pearson, utility Scottish Power and telecoms group Vodafone. \nAll said their lending to U.S. subsidiaries had been unwound and that they complied with all tax rules. Details of their lending arrangements came to public attention following data leaks or legal action with tax authorities.\nA 2013 Reuters examination of tax planning by Europe\'s largest software group, SAP AG, showed how the German company shifted profits from the United States, which has a corporate tax rate of at least 35 percent, to Ireland whose headline rate is 12.5 percent.\nhere\nHIGH-INTEREST LOANS\nAccording to Reuters calculations based on 2015 corporate filings, SAP America Inc reduces its U.S. tax bill by around $200 million a year by borrowing $7.4 billion from SAP Ireland US Financial Services Ltd at an interest rate of at least 7 percent.\nThe debt, which helped fund the acquisition of U.S. software groups, cuts its taxable income by around $600 million a year.\nA spokesman for SAP group declined to comment on the Reuters calculations but said the company followed all tax rules and that its funding structure was driven by business rather than tax reasons.\nSome measures previously proposed by Obama and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which advises developed nations on tax policy, would have limited interest deductions to the extent that they reflected an operating unit\'s share of total group interest costs.\nSince SAP group\'s total net interest expense was just 5 million euros last year, most of its U.S. subsidiary\'s deduction may have been disallowed under such proposals. \nBut the Treasury plan is far more limited than these proposals. SAP filings suggest that it has not taken large amounts of cash from its acquired U.S. subsidiaries and recapitalized them with debt. \nDebts accumulated as SAP has done – by acquiring and expanding U.S. companies - should not be captured by the new measures, even if that debt is out of proportion to the parent\'s overall debt burden. \nBut it\'s hard to be certain.\nInter-group debts usually run for a period of a few years, and each time they extend them, there is an opportunity for the IRS to re-examine the arrangement. \n\"There is certainly is a risk when they roll over that instrument, that it is going to be recharacterised as equity,\" said Victor Fleischer, professor of law at the University of San Diego, said of the SAP loans.         \n (Additional reporting by Dena Aubin in New York; Editing by Pravin Char)', '2016-04-11 14:13:00', '2016-04-11');

A Reuters/Ipsos online poll from April 4-8 showed that 42 percent of Republicans support Trump, compared with 32 percent for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 20 percent for Ohio Governor John Kasich. [L2N17B1J0]\nCruz and Kasich have both said their paths to victory rely on winning at least enough votes to block an outright win for Trump and force a decision at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\n\'I\'LL BE FED UP\'\nBut Trump, whose supporters have remained loyal even as he rankled women, Hispanics, Muslims, veterans and others with his fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail, predicted last month there would be riots outside the convention if he was blocked.\n\"If they broker him out, I’ll be fed up with the Republicans,” said Chuck Thompson, 66, a Trump supporter from Concord, North Carolina, who took the poll. \nThompson, a lifelong Republican, said he admires Trump’s independence from big campaign donors and takes that as a sign that the front-runner will be able to think for himself if he were to become president. \nIf Trump loses the nomination, Thompson said he would quit the party. “The people want Donald Trump. If they (Republicans) can’t deal with that, I don’t need them,” he said.\nGreen said the departure of even a small number of Republicans would make it tough for the party to prevent the Democrats from winning the White House, especially if the election is again decided by razor-thin margins in a handful of battleground states. \nIn 2012, President Barack Obama won Florida by less than 1 percentage point and Ohio and Virginia by less than 4 percentage points. “The Republicans don’t really have any margin of error,” Green said.\nTrump and Cruz both trail Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton among likely general election voters in a hypothetical general election matchup, but not by much, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos polls.\nGenerally, a convention battle is a bad sign for the health of a political party, said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the book, “Primary Politics: How Presidential Candidates Have Shaped the Modern Nominating System.” \n“When a party gets to a point when it has a contested convention, it almost always hurts them,” Kamarck said. “It’s a confirmation of some really deep fissures within the party that were unable to be dealt with during the primary season.”\nTrump supporter Elizabeth Oerther, 40, of Louisville, Kentucky, said she would switch parties and vote for the Democratic nominee if the Republicans denied Trump the nomination. \n\"If you don’t give it to him, I’m going to vote against them,\" said Oerther, who took the poll. “They want to take away the choice of the people.

It was known for its federal \"three strikes\" provision that sent violent offenders to prison for life. The bill was backed by congressional Republicans and hailed at the time as a success for Clinton.\nAlthough Clinton is popular among Democrats who view him as a gifted orator and crowd pleaser, he has in the past veered from the carefully calibrated message put out by his wife\'s campaign, causing problems for her representatives.\nDuring Hillary Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential bid, civil rights leaders and high-ranking Democrats in Congress criticized the former president for statements he made during a heated campaign against then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama. Bill Clinton said Obama\'s campaign had “played the race card.” Obama became the first U.S. black president in November that year.\nBill Clinton\'s remarks on Thursday drew criticism online. Some saw him as dismissive of the Black Lives Matter movement, a national outgrowth of anger over a string of encounters in which police officers killed unarmed black people.\nJohnetta Elzie, a civil rights activist, wrote online that Clinton \"can\'t handle being confronted by his own record.\"\n\"This is like watching a robot malfunction,\" she wrote.\nEarlier in Philadelphia, Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, assailed Clinton as unqualified to be president as the two campaigns became increasingly testy less than two weeks before New York\'s nominating contest.\n\"Are you qualified to be president of the United States when you\'re raising millions of dollars from Wall Street, an entity whose greed, recklessness and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy?\" Sanders said at a news conference.\nClinton this week sharply questioned Sanders\' credentials and ability to carry out a campaign pledge to break up the big banks.\nSpokesmen for Clinton noted she never said the word \"unqualified\" when she questioned his preparedness for the presidency, but they declined to say whether she believed in that characterization.\nClinton aimed for a more magnanimous tone than her aides when speaking to reporters during a subway ride in New York City.\n\"I don\'t know why he\'s saying that,\" she said of Sanders calling her unqualified. \"But I will take Bernie Sanders over Ted Cruz or Donald Trump any time,\" she said of the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination.\nSanders returned the sentiment in an interview with the \"CBS Evening News\" later on Thursday.\n\"I think the idea of a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz presidency would be an unmitigated disaster for this country. I will do everything in my power and work as hard as I can to make sure that that does not happen, and if Secretary Clinton is the nominee, I will certainly support her,\" he said. \n (Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Megan Cassella, Alana Wise and Amanda Becker in Washington; Editing by Howard Goller and Peter Cooney)', '2016-04-08 16:10:43', '2016-04-08');

But networks are already seeing more national ad buys by the Super PACs, a shift that could benefit television networks.\nThe election also has brought a ratings boon to television, which had been losing audience to Internet streaming. Fox News Channel said Wednesday it was No. 1 among basic cable networks last quarter for the first time.. CNN had the best quarter in seven years. \n\"We have seen a little bit of the Super PAC money come in,\" said Katrina Cukaj executive vice president of portfolio sales and client partnerships at Turner ad sales, part of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), which owns CNN. \"We haven\'t seen the full force of it yet. That will come when we know who the candidates are.\" \nThe frenzy in political ad spending is expected to reshape  advertiser behavior. Media buyers predict the presidential election will result in an increase in spending at this year’s so-called upfronts, where the networks present their fall line-ups and woo big advertisers with swanky parties and celebrity appearances. Upfronts run through May.\n“The Super PACs are not afraid to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in just a few local stations, so it wouldn’t surprise me if the national election is going to have a real impact on the upfronts,” said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.\nLowenthal expects pricing for advertising to go up as a result of the Super PAC spending. \nMore advertisers are expected to lock in ad spots for the fourth quarter, rather than face price increases later or risk getting shut out of the market. Media buyers say they expect up to a 5 percent increase in spending for this year\'s upfronts – the first increase in two years.\nThat could mean a jump in spending of up to $8.9 billion for prime time spots alone, based on data from Media Dynamics.\nPresidential ad spending for cable and broadcast television and radio in 2016 has already surpassed the $300 million mark, up more than 200 percent from the same period in the 2012 election cycle, according to data from Smart Media Group. \n“This is going to be a very good year for us,” said CBS Chair and CEO Les Moonves at an investment conference in February.\n“It’s a terrible thing to say, but bring it on Donald.

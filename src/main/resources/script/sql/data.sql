Allowing consumers to chose devices or apps they can own could mean quick savings, according to the administration.  \n\"Competition is good for consumers,\" President Barack Obama said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \"And ultimately it\'s good for business. The more competition we have, the more products, services, innovation takes place.\"\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February proposed a rule to open competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. \nIt set a 60-day comment period for the rule that could deal a financial blow to cable companies. The administration issued a rare filing on the rule by the FCC, an independent agency. \nThe rule would allow consumers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Inc\'s Google, Apple Inc and TiVo In, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers such Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc.\nIt was unclear if the rule will be implemented before Obama leaves office in January.\nCable and television companies have lashed out against the proposal, saying it could stifle innovation. Under the rule, minority programmers would be damaged, consumers would lose privacy protections and be saddled with the costs of re-engineering networks, said Michael Powell, the head of trade group National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association.  \nThe companies also contended the White House is pressuring the FCC, which they said was inappropriate. \"This action not only damages the only companies seriously investing to build broadband infrastructure for this country, it also does great harm to the confidence we should be able to have in the impartiality of the FCC\'s proceedings,\" said Jim Cicconi, a senior executive vice president at AT&amp;T; Inc.\nObama will also sign an executive order on Friday calling on federal agencies and departments to report in 60 days on areas where additional measures can be taken to open competition.\nIn a teleconference call with reporters, Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, would not speculate on what kind of pro-competition measures the order could spur.

That may not seem like a big number, but both men are engaged in a fierce struggle to win as many as possible of the party insiders who could decide the presidential nominee at a contested convention.\nCruz\'s strength in Wyoming underscores the contrast between the way the rivals handle this nuance of American politics: where Cruz focuses on organizing at a minute level to court delegates in preparation for a convention fight, Trump has run a national campaign focused on winning the popular vote in early nominating contests and has paid little attention to the more arcane elements of U.S. presidential politics.\nCruz\'s effort has included personal visits to far-flung areas, regular conference calls among his state supporters, and hospitality suites to court backers within state parties, while Trump has assailed the delegate system as \"rigged\" and only recently reorganized his campaign to focus on them.\n\"I think Cruz has done a good job with how they targeted states,\" said Jason Osborne, a Republican strategist who has advised Trump, and who previously worked on former candidate Ben Carson\'s campaign. “An operation like Trump’s was built for something completely different.\"\nTrump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe United States has a unique system for picking presidential nominees. A combination of nominating polls – usually in the form of state primaries, caucuses, and party conventions – are used to apportion delegates to candidates.\nIn the Republican race, a candidate needs to win a majority of the total 2,472 delegates to get the nomination. While Trump has won 21 state nominating contests so far to Cruz\'s nine, the billionaire leads the Texas senator by only 208 delegates (743-545).\nTo avoid a convention fight, Trump needs 1,237 delegates to secure the nomination. That means he has to win nearly 60 percent of the remaining delegates before July.\nKEEP THE PROMISE\nCruz\'s effort in Wyoming, America\'s least populous state, is a window into his broader delegate strategy and helps explain how he has become a formidable candidate despite his relatively underdog performance in the primaries so far.\nThe effort began in 2015, while most other candidates were focused on the early races in Iowa or New Hampshire. Ed Buchanan, a trial attorney in Cheyenne, got a call from Heidi Cruz, the candidate\'s wife, in October asking if he would become the state chairman for Cruz\'s presidential campaign.\nBuchanan, a former speaker of the State House, agreed to the role, which has taken him to every corner of the state trying to court support and build a slate of delegates.\nSome states allow the voters to select the delegates who will attend the Republican convention on their behalf, but in most, like Wyoming, Colorado and North Dakota, voters have no say in who goes to Cleveland.\nIf Trump doesn\'t have the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright, many delegates will become free at the July convention to pick a candidate based on their personal preference, not the choice of the voters in their state.\nThat is why campaigns want their supporters among the delegates and that is where Buchanan comes in.\nHe is responsible for assembling a list of the Cruz campaign\'s preferred delegates, which he will present to the Casper conference. Each would-be Cruz delegate has promised not to switch allegiances if the voting at the Cleveland convention goes beyond one ballot.\nBuchanan expects them to stick to their word. If they don\'t, it will not go unnoticed, he said.\n\"It\'s a small state.

Negotiators were moving forward on the makeup of a proposed oversight board, Pelosi said, but a \"new wrinkle\" has emerged over the role of creditors in the U.S. commonwealth\'s debt restructuring decisions.\nRyan said an oversight board would be the best possible way to prevent taxpayers from bailing out Puerto Rico.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-04-14 16:58:47', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-04-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

Former U.S. Representative Ray Thornton of Arkansas, who helped draft the articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon, has died in hospice care in Little Rock at the age of 87, officials said on Thursday.\n\"Ray was an Arkansas gem who passionately served the people of this state for many years. He was a man who had a genuine heart for the people of Arkansas.\" said Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson.    \nThornton, a Democrat, held a variety of elected and appointive positions in Arkansas. He was state attorney general before winning a seat in Congress in 1972.  \nAfter failing to win a U.S. Senate race in 1978, Thornton served as president of two state university systems, then ran successfully in 1990 for U.S. Congress in a different district.\n\"He was courageous in the House of Representatives with his votes on the Nixon impeachment,\" said Robert Brown, a retired justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court and a former political aide. \n\"Ray did as much as a public servant in Arkansas as anyone in recent history, and he did it all with a courtliness and sense of humor that seem to be sorely lacking in today\'s politics.\"\nThornton, whose health had been declining for weeks before he died on Wednesday, enraged then-President Bill Clinton, a fellow Arkansan and Democrat, by voting against the president\'s 1993 budget bill designed to reverse years of deficits. \nThornton said he was merely honoring a pledge to his constituents to oppose any tax increases, especially a motor fuels tax regarded as onerous. \nThornton’s opposition and pressure from the White House compelled another Democrat, Representative Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky of Pennsylvania, to change her position and support Clinton’s legislation. \nMezvinsky was defeated in the next election. Her son, Marc, later married Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea.\nUpon leaving Congress a second time, Thornton was elected to the Arkansas Supreme Court, where he helped strike down a state law establishing term limits for members of Congress. \nIn 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Thornton’s finding, ruling that state’s lacked the authority to restrict federal tenures.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-04-14 16:09:26', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-04-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

The aid package for Cairo has been in focus in Washington because of growing unease among both Ryan\'s fellow Republicans and Democrats that Sisi\'s government is exploiting security concerns to crack down on dissent.\nRyan said he told Sisi: \"You make it more difficult for us to be supportive of you when you have so many human rights violations,\" adding that every U.S. official who visited Cairo should make that case.\nHowever, he stressed that it is essential that Washington not allow Egypt to become a failed state.\nRyan also told reporters it was \"too soon\" to weigh in on an emergency funding \"Marshall Plan\" that some lawmakers have proposed to boost countries in the region socially and economically rather than only focus on military aspects in the fight to counter Islamic State and other militant groups.\n\"I think it\'s too soon to jump to that conclusion,\" Ryan said, when asked whether he would support some sort of emergency appropriations program like the \"Marshall Plan\" suggested by  fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.\n (Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe)', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-04-14 14:18:48', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-04-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

Wiley, a long-time Republican strategist, had been campaign manager for Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor who dropped out of the presidential race last autumn.\n\"He brings decades of experience, and his deep ties to political leaders and activists across the country will be a tremendous asset as we enter the final phase of securing the nomination,\" Trump said in a statement.\nIn addition, Trump\'s campaign arranged a meeting in Washington of about a dozen U.S. legislators as the fierce anti-establishment candidate tries to build more relationships inside Washington and broaden his appeal.\nThe meeting with the lawmakers and senior Trump adviser Ed Brookover is planned for Thursday morning on Capitol Hill, congressional aides said.\nAbout a dozen lawmakers are expected to attend, some of whom have endorsed Trump and some of whom have not but who are interested in his message. Trump will not be there.\nA series of policy speeches Trump plans to begin delivering soon could be among the topics discussed, one source said.\n\"They\'re definitely planning several policy speeches ... and they are looking for input on those,\" a Republican source familiar with the situation said.\nKELLY: \"CHANCE TO CLEAR THE AIR\"\nThe Trump campaign received some good news when Politico reported that campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was charged last month in Florida with battery on a reporter, will not be prosecuted.\nPalm Beach County State Attorney David Aronberg is scheduled to announce the decision not to press charges on Thursday afternoon, Politico reported, citing sources with knowledge of the situation.\nIn another development, Trump met privately at Trump Tower in New York with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after months of attacking her for the tough questions she asked him at a Republican debate last August about his treatment of women.\nTensions between Trump and Kelly, and controversial remarks he has made about abortion, have contributed to Trump\'s negative image with women. Opinion polls show the New York billionaire is viewed unfavorably by women by a wide margin.\nKelly said on her Fox News show she had asked for the meeting and used it to request an interview. \"We met for about an hour just the two of us and had a chance to clear the air,\" she said.\nIn recent days Trump has attempted to soften his image with important constituencies such as female voters.\nA group interview on CNN on Tuesday night featured Trump, his wife, Melania, daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr., and showed a more personal side to the often-brusque businessman.\nMelania Trump said she had fussed at Trump to stop tweeting at night. \"If he would only listen,\" she said, chuckling.\nPROSPECT OF CONTESTED CONVENTION\nRepublican strategist Ron Bonjean said the hiring of Wiley and, two weeks ago, of delegate specialist Paul Manafort suggest that Trump is preparing for a contested convention in July should he not win outright the 1,237 delegates needed for the Republican presidential nomination. \n\"Without having good people on your team who understand how to navigate those waters, you\'re in big trouble,\" he said.\nThe steps point to a new phase of Trump\'s campaign after vulnerabilities were exposed when he was beaten in Wisconsin by Cruz and outmaneuvered by Cruz in the competition for delegates in Colorado.\nAs the Trump campaign attempts to get a better handle on the complicated delegate selection process, Trump is expected to send a contingent to a Republican National Committee (RNC) meeting in Florida next week.\nTrump has been in a war of words with the RNC, accusing the party apparatus of having rules that, for example, allowed party regulars in Colorado to select delegates without giving Republicans there a chance to vote.\nTrump on Tuesday said that RNC Chairman Reince Priebus \"should be ashamed of himself.\"\nPriebus, who met Trump two weeks ago at RNC headquarters in Washington, said the delegate-selection rules have been in place for a year and it is the responsibility of each campaign to understand them.\n\"Complaints now? Give us all a break,\" Priebus tweeted.\n (Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Leslie Adler)', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-04-14 13:32:07', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), TO_DATE('2016-04-14', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
